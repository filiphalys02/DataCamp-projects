Since you're still in the startup phase, you're handling everything yourself, including writing the software to manage complex scheduling and timing across different space colonies.\n\nBefore developing a full rocket flight planning and logistics system, you want to create core functions using Python's datetime module to handle dates, times, and durations. These basic functions are essential for your rocket delivery service. In this project, you will make simple reusable functions for working with timestamps, calculating rocket landing times based on launch and travel duration, and figuring out days until a delivery deadline to keep those customers updated!\n\nThis project is data-less, but you can test your functions by calling them in the workspace and passing them the required variables.","metadata":{},"id":"d23e9759-c345-4665-9b02-eaf3932cfa51","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":3556,"lastExecutedAt":1739531885631,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta","lastExecutedByKernel":"40d81d33-e34b-4b4f-acf7-6ab291577771"},"id":"b73875a4-ec41-4739-8670-764f75f2804f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Start coding here.
